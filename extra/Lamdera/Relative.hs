-- These help with loading relative file paths from the compiler codebase when we're developing in GHCI and the current working directory isn't reliably set
-- This happens because the Elm compiler relies on the current working directory to find project roots, so in our test suite we end up needing to modify this value a fair bit
-- These helpers currently expect that the lamdera-compiler codebase is checked out to `~/dev/projects/lamdera-compiler`
