Kept for reference. Search `Lamdera.OldFeatureHelper` to see commented-out inclusion points.

Was added to help folks missing LocalDev deps to elm/http & elm/time have a nicer error
message for that particular case, but in the end decided better to have Lamdera.Debug expose
those bits and it remain an indirect dependency.
