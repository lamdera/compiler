{-

   Notice how the attributes `.a` and `.dog` are both statically called â€“ that's because
   Wire's record encoding is lexicographically ordered by field name.

   We're specifically _not_ calling w3_encode_A, because if we did, we'd have to chose
   between one of two implementations:

    Lamdera.Wire3.encodeSequenceWithoutLength
        (w3_encode_A w3_rec_var0
            ++ [ Lamdera.Wire3.encodeUnit w3_rec_var0.dog
               ]
        )

    Lamdera.Wire3.encodeSequenceWithoutLength
        ([ Lamdera.Wire3.encodeUnit w3_rec_var0.dog
         ]
            ++ w3_encode_A w3_rec_var0
        )

    In this specific case, the first one is correct, because `a` comes before `dog`,
    but if the attribute was `x`, it would be the second one.

    So to fix _that_, we'd need to return some extra info such that a caller could
    sort the attributes... aaand now we're really getting into the weeds.


    So we're effectively saying "if you're going to use an extensible record, then use a
    type alias that concretely fills all type vars, and then use that type instead".

    This leaves us with an outstanding problem for anonymous extensible records, i.e.:

    type alias SomeRecord =
        { herp : String
        , derp : Int
        , extensible : A { dog : String }
        }

    Here we've got the `A { dog : String }` in the middle of the record, and we can't
    just use `A { dog : String }` as a type, because it's not a concrete type, and as
    we just discussed, we can't make wire encoding/decoding functions for it on the fly,
    because we can't sort the attributes. It needs to be concrete.
